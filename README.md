# mvcTHUB

This is my personal project that i created from scratch. As this project is still in production it has all functions from .Net Identity. The main object of this project is that it will be an environment for Tournament/Leagues creaton for multiple sports/esports.
Ignore front-end because it has almost nothing done to it expect a random bootstrap theme attached to it.




#install

Requirements: .Net 8
